# Landmass Generation
 
This is a project developed to showcase procedural generation of landscape using the Perlin Noise algorithm. The user can set different scale noise, lacunarity, persistence and offset to control the landscape generation. I have also added support to export the generated result as a RAW heightmap. This can then be imported using Unityâ€™s Terrain component for further editing.
