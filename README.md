# Landmass Generation
 
This is a project developed to showcase procedural generation of landscape using the Perlin Noise algorithm. 
The user can set different scale noise, lacunarity, persistence and offset to control the landscape generation. 
I have also added support to export the generated result as a RAW heightmap. This can then be imported using Unityâ€™s Terrain component for further editing.

> Generate mesh with specific size resolution and able to tune different values such noise scale, lacunarity, persistence, octaves and offset the noise. 
> Push the generate button and check new result.

> Export the landscape as raw file and png. Unity Terrain component is able to support to read and import this raw file and generate the heightmap.
